# GAN-Doc-Quality
The repository `Sajid-Bit/GAN-Doc-Quality` focuses on improving the quality of documents using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). It includes the implementation, datasets, and results of the project aimed at enhancing document image quality.

The `data` folder contains two subdirectories:
- `img_A`: This folder contains images with low quality.
- `img_B`: This folder contains images with high quality.
